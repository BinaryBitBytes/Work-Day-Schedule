# Goals for this portfolio
---

My primary goal is to  allow users to set up a task manager for their workday. I want to grow this project by creatinge  the ability for users to structure their day in tasks and save that list of tasks in a hourly format for the work day. I hope to be able to let the future tasks , present tasks, and overdue tasks get highleted in red yellow and green.
